# ISOM1090  Midterm Study Guide 

## Purpose of the mid-term to evaluate students’ ability to:
* **Articulate the origin, characteristics and principles of Web 2.0**
* **Explain Long Tail and Network effect**
* **Explain the Database of Intentions**
* **Define Wisdom of Crowds & Collective Intelligence**
* **Understand the applications of WoW & CI concept: Crowdsourcing**
* **Understand the characteristics of Folksonomy**

## Web 2.0
* **Differences between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0**
  * Web 1.0 provided agency generated content, used the desktop as a platform, was centralized and was difficult for anyone but professionals to use. Web 2.0, on the other hand, had user-generated content, used the web as a platform, was decentralized and had platforms that made services easily available to amateurs.
* **New vs not new Web 2.0 services**
  * According to Tim Berners-Lee, Web 2.0 is simply an improved form of Web 1.0. Features that weren't new included blogs, the Wiki and user-generated content. Features that were new in Web 2.0 include mashups, the improved scale of participation and the overall ease of use.
* **Meme map of web 2.0**
  * **MEMORIZE (WUSP VDC):** Web as a Platform, Services not Packages, Perpetual Beta, Viral Marketing, Decentralisation, Collaboration and User Generated Content
    * WAP refers to the web being used as a platform as opposed to the desktop, SNP refers to the applications being available on the web as opposed to downloadable software, Perpetual Beta refers to Web 2.0 being constantly in progress or in a state of growth, Viral Marketing refers to increasing brand awareness through users instead of advertisements, Decentralisation refers to content not coming from a centralised authority, Collaboration&User Generated Content refers to users contributing and working together to produce content
* **The Foundation and Experience attributes of Web 2.0**
  * **FOUNDATION (NUL)**: Network Effect, User-contributed Value, Long Tail
    * Foundation attributes frame the economic model of Web 2.0. Users contribute to the overall value of the service (Emergent System), the value of a network increases with each user, and the sales of the top products are beaten by those of all niche products.
  * **EXPERIENCE (CRED)**: Co-Creation, Remixability, Emergent Systems, Decentralisation
        * Experience attributes create unique services not found in Web 1.0. Co-creation refers to users participating in generating content, Remixability refers to the tailoring of experiences using multiple services, Emergent Systems refers to the value of content at the lowest level to make up the overall value of a system, and Decentralisation refers to the content not coming from a centralised authority.
* **Characteristics of Emergent System**
  * Cumulative actions at the lowest levels of production make up the overall value of a system.
  * Users can mold the overall value or shape of a service depending on their behaviour.

* **Principles of Wikinomics**
  * **MEMORIZE (SOP)**: Sharing, Openness, Peering
    * Sharing refers to expanding markets to create new opportunities, Openness refers to the transparency and easy of access of information, and Peering refers to the horizontal (non-hierarchical), eligalitarian system/atmosphere.
* **Web 2.0 detractors**
    * **Jaron Lanier** talks about Digital Maoism and how Web 2.0 needs a gatekeeper due to the redundancy or repetitiveness of the published information. **Andrew Keen** talks about Web 2.0 being the Cult of the Amateur and the Age of Exhibitionism, due to the ease of access provided by platforms allowing people to publish multiple kinds of information about their lives. He also mentions Digital Vertigo, which talks about how people become more alienated from each other the more they become connected on the web. **Evgeny Morozov* talks about how people use the internet as a platform for protesting, and how the government uses it to censor information and provide entertainment to pacify crowds. 
* **Define Streisand Effect**
  * Streisand Effect refers to the phenomenon where attempting to hide information on the internet results in it becoming more publicized than what would have occurred if no action had been taken to hide it.
* **Define Web Troll**
  * People who post on the internet to agitate other users; an online version of the lynch mob. They are also a symptom of society's bigger problems, such as ableism and racism.
