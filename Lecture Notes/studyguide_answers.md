## Web 2.0
* **Differences between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0**
  * Web 1.0 provided agency generated content, used the desktop as a platform, was centralized and was difficult for anyone but professionals to use. Web 2.0, on the other hand, had user-generated content, used the web as a platform, was decentralized and had platforms that made services easily available to amateurs.
* **New vs not new Web 2.0 services**
  * According to Tim Berners-Lee, Web 2.0 is simply an improved form of Web 1.0. Features that weren't new included blogs, the Wiki and user-generated content. Features that were new in Web 2.0 include mashups, the improved scale of participation and the overall ease of use.
* **Meme map of web 2.0**
  * **MEMORIZE (WUSP VDC):** Web as a Platform, Services not Packages, Perpetual Beta, Viral Marketing, Decentralisation, Collaboration and User Generated Content
    * WAP refers to the web being used as a platform as opposed to the desktop, SNP refers to the applications being available on the web as opposed to downloadable software, Perpetual Beta refers to Web 2.0 being constantly in progress or in a state of growth, Viral Marketing refers to increasing brand awareness through users instead of advertisements, Decentralisation refers to content not coming from a centralised authority, Collaboration&User Generated Content refers to users contributing and working together to produce content
* **The Foundation and Experience attributes of Web 2.0**
  * **FOUNDATION (NUL)**: Network Effect, User-contributed Value, Long Tail
    * Foundation attributes frame the economic model of Web 2.0. Users contribute to the overall value of the service (Emergent System), the value of a network increases with each user, and the sales of the top products are beaten by those of all niche products.
  * **EXPERIENCE (CRED)**: Co-Creation, Remixability, Emergent Systems, Decentralisation
        * Experience attributes create unique services not found in Web 1.0. Co-creation refers to users participating in generating content, Remixability refers to the tailoring of experiences using multiple services, Emergent Systems refers to the value of content at the lowest level to make up the overall value of a system, and Decentralisation refers to the content not coming from a centralised authority.
* **Characteristics of Emergent System**
  * Cumulative actions at the lowest levels of production make up the overall value of a system.
  * Users can mold the overall value or shape of a service depending on their behaviour.
* **Principles of Wikinomics**
  * **MEMORIZE (SOP)**: Sharing, Openness, Peering
    * Sharing refers to expanding markets to create new opportunities, Openness refers to the transparency and easy of access of information, and Peering refers to the horizontal (non-hierarchical), eligalitarian system/atmosphere.
* **Web 2.0 detractors**
    * **Jaron Lanier** talks about how Web 2.0 needs a gatekeeper due to the redundancy or repetitiveness of the published information. He also talks about Digital Maoism, where crowd mentalities are favored above individual identities. **Andrew Keen** talks about Web 2.0 being the Cult of the Amateur and the Age of Exhibitionism, due to the ease of access provided by platforms allowing people to publish multiple kinds of information about their lives. He also mentions Digital Vertigo, which talks about how people become more alienated from each other the more they become connected on the web. **Evgeny Morozov* talks about how people use the internet as a platform for protesting, and how the government uses it to censor information and provide entertainment to pacify crowds. 
* **Define Streisand Effect**
  * Streisand Effect refers to the phenomenon where attempting to hide information on the internet results in it becoming more publicized than what would have occurred if no action had been taken to hide it.
* **Define Web Troll**
  * People who post on the internet to agitate other users; an online version of the lynch mob. They are also a symptom of society's bigger problems, such as ableism and racism.

## Network Effect and Long Tail
* **Sources of network effect**
  * **MEMORIZE [PUNT]**: Person to Person Communication, User Generated Content, Nodes in a Network, Trading Volume
    * P2PC refers to how many people use a platform (eg. Telephone, Email), User Generated Content refers to the amount of content in the system (eg. Wikipedia, Online Communities), Nodes in a Network refers (eg. Bittorent, P2P Networks), and Trading Volume refers to the number of partners/users in two sided markets (eg. eBay, Uber)
* **Network structure of network effect**
  * One Sided Markets derive value from the same type of users (eg. Facebook users attract other Facebook Users), while Two Sided Markets derive value from two types of users (eg. eBay Buyers and Sellers, Uber Passengers and Drivers)
* **Basic idea of Long Tail**
  * Long Tail refers to how niche products make up a market share that rivals or exceeds that of the best sellers, following Pareto's Principle.
* **Long tail and Web 2.0 (Effects)**
  * Web 2.0 has three main effects on the long tail. Democratising the tools of production allows users to generate more content, which makes the tail longer. Democratising the tools of distribution allows users to distribute or access niche products more, which fattens the tail. Connecting supply and demand drive businesses from hits to niches, which narrows the head.

## Search and Database of Intentions
* **How search engine works : The 3 components of search engine**
  * The search engine has three components; the spider or web crawler parses and analyzes words and links all over the web, the index algorithm which creates an index to return meaningful results for each query, and the query processor which which receives a query and returns results based on the index.
* **History of search engine [Archie & Alta Vista]**
  * Archie is a searchable directory of FTP files, while AltaVisa provided an index of web pages and efficient search. 
* **Search engines and political analogy**
  * AltaVista can be compared to an anarchy as there was no order, Yahoo can be compared to a dictatorship because the web pages in the index were placed by a certain group of people, while Google's PageRank can be compared to a democracy/People's Power as the ranking system was based on votes.
* **How PageRank works**
  * PageRank responds to a query by returning a list of web pages ranked by their credibility. This credibility was recursively judged by counting how many times the site has been linked to from other websites, whose credibilities were also judged following the same pattern.
* **Database of intentions in 2010 [the four signals]**
  * The Query [Google, Bing], The Social Graph [Facebook, MySpace], The Status Update [Facebook, Twitter], The Check-in [Foursquare]

## Collective Intelligence
* **Definition of Collective intelligence [Key Terms]**
  * Nobody knows everything, everyone knows something (Harness latent microexpertise)
  * **MEMORIZE (SER)**: Share correct information, Evaluate each others' results, Reach a consensus
  * **MEMORIZE (DCHC)**: Distributed Intelligence, Coordinated, Human Community, Collaboration
* **Collective behaviour in ant colony & double bridge experiment**
  * **MEMORIZE (GRARE)**: Group of Actors, Resources available to the Group, Actions that the actors take, Collective Result of the Actions, Evaluate the result
    * Collective Intelligence has 5 identifiers, which can all be related to the ants. A group of actors is represented by the ant colony. The resources available to the group is represented by food. The actions taken by the actors is represented by leaving pheremone. The collected result of the actions is represented by by the accumulations of the pheremone. Finally, the result is evaluated by looking at the distance covered by pheremones and the amount of food retrieved. 
    * In the double bridge experiment, a more or less similar number of ants take both the longer and shorter path, leaving pheremones in both. On the way back, however, the ants are able to return using the shorter bridge as a result of the pheremones left behind. 
* **Types of problems that WoC are good at**
  * **MEMORIZE (CCC)**: Cognition, Cooperation, Coordination
    * Cognition Problems have a definite answer, Cooperation Problems involve collective efforts of people who volunteer to achieve specified objectives, and Coordination Problems is self-organizing, fluid and involves taking the thoughts of others into account when making decisions.
* **The four conditions for wise crowds**
  * **MEMORIZE (DADI)**: Diversity of Opinions, Aggregation, Decentralisation, Independence
    * Diversity of Opinions is important as diversity yields superior results, and due to the latent microexpertise found in every individual. Aggregation is important as a consensus or verdict must be reached collectively. Decentralisation is important as the decisions have to be made by individuals, and not by a separate authority. Lastly, independence is important in order to avoid groupthinking, which can lead to situations similar to the Circular Mill.
* **Why sometimes crowds are dumb**
  * **MEMORIZE (GSC)**: Groupthink, Social Dilemma, Coordination Failures
    * Groupthink occurs when people conform to the ideas of others instead of thinking critically (Herd Mentality), which results in a lack of contributions to the aggregated result. It can be remedied by fostering diversity and independence. Social Dilemma occurs when the whole is less than the sum of the parts due to the *Tragedy of Commons*, which occurs when people put short term priorities over long term ones. It can be remedied by rewarding individual participation. Coordination Failures occur when people's contributions cancel out or interfere with those of others, and can be remedied by coordinating individual contributions.
* **CI vs. WoC**
  * Collective Intelligence focuses more on reaching a consensus where participants collect, share, evaluate and aggregate information together. Wisdom of Crowds focuses more on aggregating anonymously produced and isolated data.

## Crowdsourcing
* **Typology of problem solving on the internet**
  * **MEMORIZE (ICSO)**: Individual/Collective, Single Solution/Open Ended
    * Individual Single Solution Solutions can be seen in Yahoo Questions and Naver. Individual Open Ended Solutions can be seen in Lego's Crowdsourcing. Collective Single Solution can be seen through Ted's Translation Project. Collective Open Ended Solutions can be seen in Open Source.
* **Crowdsourcing vs. outsourcing**
  * Crowdsourcing is usually open though the company eventually ends up keeping Intellectual Property, and doesn't involve employees or any notion of a team. Outsourcing on the other hand is closed, and involves external employees and teams. Crowdsourcing is also cheaper than outsourcing.
* **Crowdsourcing application: Questions**
  * This method of crowd sourcing involves directly asking a question to the community, as observed in Naver and Yahoo! Questions.
* **Crowdsourcing application: Distributed Innovation**
  * This method of crowd sourcing involves users solving problems for cash, and companies looking for solutions to problems and looking to acquire intellectual property as observed in InnoCentive and P&G's Pringles Print.
* **Crowdsourcing application: Innovation Prize**
  * This method of crowd sourcing involves presenting a problem open for anyone to solve for a sum of money, as observed in Netflix's Million Dollar Challenge and Topcoder.
* **Crowdsourcing application: Citizen Science**
  * This method of crowd sourcing involves conducting research with the help of amateur or nonprofessional volunteers, as observed in Zooniverse.
* **Crowdsourcing application: Content Rating**
  * This method of crowd sourcing involves creating new content by making users organize existing cottent, as observed in Reddit or Yahoo Buzz.
* **Crowdsourcing application: Prediction Market**
  * This method of crowd sourcing involves creating speculative markets for the purpose of making predictions on the popularity of trends, as seen in Hollywood Exchange.
* **Crowdsourcing application: Service Marketplace**
  * This method of crowd sourcing revolves around freelance work, and involves businesses posting jobs and searching for freelance professionals as observed in Elance and crowdSpring.
* **Crowdsourcing application: Crowdfunding**
  * This method of crowd sourcing asks users to donate money to a cause, as observed in Kickstarter.
* **Crowdsourcing application: Micro Task**
* **Not so successful examples of Crowdsourcing: Assignment Zero**
