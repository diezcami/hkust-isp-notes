# Lecture 1 (Web 2.0)

## Key Terms
* The Streisand Effect
* Levelling Effect
* Internet as a Platform
* User Generated Content

## The World is Flat (by Thomas Friedman)
* The world's competitive level is more or less even, and anyone can compete (G7, G20)
* **Fall of Berlin Wall**: 
  * Opened a market for the Western countries to sell their products, as well as a labor force
  * Also the year when Windows was developed
* **Netscape**:
  * Web Browser which made the internet accessible
* **Software with Compatible Interfaces and File Formats**:
  * Countries had different file formats, which made it difficult to communicate
  * HTML was created to uniform presentation of data, which made it easier to communicate and collaborate
* **Open Source**:
  * Anybody can contribute to existing projects
  * Collaboration results to collective intelligence
* **Outsourcing**:
  * Purchasing from an external source as opposed to producing it internally
* **Offshoring**:
  * Moving the manufacturing operations outside the country (*eg. Made in China*)
* **Supply Chaining**:
  * System of organizations involved in moving several products or services from product to customer.
* **Insourcing**:
  * Opposite of Outsourcing; Performing tasks internally as opposed to externally
* **In-forming**:
  * People are more informed given the advent of the internet 
* **Steroids**:
  * Technological Advancement: Internet, Cloud Computing, Hardware
  * Developed to make technology easier for the public to access.

## The Streisand Effect
* **Spread this Number (Digg)**
  * The hash code (09 F9 11 02) for decrypting information was found, which made piracy possible.
  * The public knew of the number and incident once the authorities ordered to have it removed.
* **Ryan Gills**
  * Was having an affair with somebody
  * The newspaper published an anonymous article about him, though it wasn't effective as social media had already spread information about him
* The more you want to suppress the information, the more popular it becomes.
  * There's no point in suppressing what you want to hide due to the nature of social media.
  * The leveling in the spread of information is even -people power the supply of information as opposed to news companies.

## Levelling Effect
* Produces a more open and non-hierarchical society

## Web 2.0
* **Dot Com Crash**
 * Interesting companies (eg. Google, Amazon) emerged after the crash
* We are in an era with a lot of available services that allows users to collaborate and share information.
* Web 1.0 was targeted towards researchers and people who wanted to display their information, while Web 2.0 is targeted towards the general public sharing what they find interesting (eg. Cute Cat Theory).
* **Synonyms**
  * The Participatory Web
  * The Amateurization of the Web
  * The Social Web
* **Foundation Attributes**
  * User Contributed Value
  * The Long Tail
  * Network Effect
* **Principles (Adaptive Path)**
  * Remixability - Experiences are created and tailored to user needs (eg. Google Maps)
    * OpenRice only showed restaurants before, now they also provide locations via Google Maps
  * Co-creation - Users participate in the creation and delivery of a service (eg. Wikipedia)
  * Emergent Systems - Cumulative actions at the lowest levels of the system drive the form and value of the overall system (eg. Wikipedia)
    * Users define behaviour of the service (Bottom-up System)
  * Decentralization - Users experience services on their terms, and not those of a centralized authority

## Web 2.0 is..
* **Rich "Non-weblike" Environment**: Web Amateurization, feels like you're using applications directly from your desktop
* **Viral Marketing and Permission Based Activity**: Viral, from the word Virus - spreading a message rapidly.
* **Collaboration**: People working together collectively, open source software, etc.
* **Radical Decentralisation**: Eliminating the centralised hierarchy
  * eg. BitTorrent: Users do both uploading and downloading
* **Mashups**: Remixability (eg. using Google Maps with other services)
* **User Generated Content**: 
* **Creative Commons**: A license that allows collaborations and sharing

## Web 2.0 Meme Map (Mentioned Points)
* An attitude, not a technology
* **The Perpetual Beta (Non-final software open to public)**: There's no final version of the Web
* Emergent: User behaviour is not predetermined
* **Rich User Experience**: Tied with non-weblike environment
* **PageRank**: Algorithm used in search engines, reviews and reputations (rankings in general)
* **Customer self-service enabling the long tail**: eg. Google Adsense
* **Radical Trust**: eg. Wikipedia
* **Core Competencies**
  * The Web as a Platform
  * Services, not packaged software (eg. Gmail, Facebook, Wechat etc are services, not software)
  * Cost Effective Scalability
  * Remixable Data Source and Data Transformations
  * Harnessing Collective Intelligence 

## Web 2.0 Features
* RSS Feeds
* Social Bookmarking (Tagging, Categorizing)
* Rating and Recommendations
* Blogging
* Rich User Interfaces (AJAX): Script Language to enhance services (eg. Online Shopping)

## Summing Up
* Definition of **Open**:
  * Accessibility/Public
  * Free
  * No Boundary; Crossing Borders
  * Editable
* **Importance of Openness**
  * Software (Open Source Software)
  * Open Content (Blogs, Wikis Creative Common)
  * Open Data (Mashups)
  * Open Knowledge (OpenCourseWare, Digital Library)
* **Importance of Users**

## Bad vs Good vs Gray Area
* **Lost Cellphone**
  * Punishment was too much and doesn't fit the crime (modern equivalent of a *lynch mob*)
  * Internet made it easy for a normal man to destroy the reputation of a complete stranger
