## The Streisand Effect
* **Spread this Number (Digg)**
  * The hash code (09 F9 11 02) for decrypting information was found, which made piracy possible.
  * The public knew of the number and incident once the authorities ordered to have it removed.
* **Ryan Gills**
  * Was having an affair with somebody
  * The newspaper published an anonymous article about him, though it wasn't effective as social media had already spread information about him
* The more you want to suppress the information, the more popular it becomes.
  * There's no point in suppressing what you want to hide due to the nature of social media 
  * The leveling in the spread of information is even -people power the supply of information as opposed to news companies

## Levelling Effect
* Produces a more open and non-hierarchical society

## Web 2.0

 * Interesting companies (eg. Google, Amazon) emerged after the crash
* We are in an era with a lot of available services that allows users to collaborate and share information
* Web 1.0 was targeted towards researchers and people who wanted to display their information, while Web 2.0 is targeted towards the general public sharing what they find interesting (eg. Cute Cat Theory)
