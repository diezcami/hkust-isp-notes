# Network Effect and Long Tail
* Allow Web 2.0 services to scale (supply and demand side) efficiently and meet the demand of users.
* **Network Effect**: Value of a product increases as the number of users grows (eg. Windows, Facebook, eBay, Bluray, 3pin Sockets)
  * **Sources**: P2P Communication (Telephone), Trading Volume (eBay), Nodes in a Network (Bittorrent), User-Generated Content (Wikipedia)
  * **Congestion**: More users = Less Valuable (Traffic, Internet Congestion)

  * One Sided: Derive their value from a single class of users (eg. WeChat, Facebook)
  * Two Sided: Derive value from two categories of network participants (eg. eBay, Uber)

* **Long Tail**: Products with low demand = 80 (Tail), Best Sellers = 20 (Head)
  * Market Shares of the 80 rival or exceed the 20
  * Chris Anderson

  * **Connect supply and demand**: Hits to Niches
* **The Cuckoo's Calling**: Exception to Long Tail

# Search - Database of Intention
* Search plays an important role in finding the "tail" end of the Long Tail.  Therefore, it is important that we look at the history of search and how our search records and history form what John Battelle called "the database of intention". 
* Information Retrieval System Designed to help find information (eg. Pages, Images) on the WWW
* **Three Parts**
  * Automated Web Browser (Spider): Parses words and links on the web
  * Proprietary Algorithm (Index Algorithm): Creates an index of meaningful results per query
  * Query Processor: Receives request, compares to entries in the index, returns results
* **Database of Intention**: Every search entry contributes to a pattern that can be analyzed and use for prediction (placeholder for intentions of humankind).
  * **The Query**: Google, Yahoo, Bing
  * **The Social Graph**: Facebook, MySpace
  * **The Status Update**: Twitter, Facebook
  * **The Check In**: Foursquare, Yelp
* **History of Search Engines**
  * **Archie**: Searchable directory of FTP Files
  * **Gopher**: Used Gopher Hierarchy (FTP)
  * **Wandex**: First WWW Engine, captured URL's and entered into DB
  * **WebCrawler**: First crawler to index entire pages
  * **AltaVista**: Indexed Webpages and provided efficient search, no gov't or rules (Anarchy)
  * **Yahoo**: Web Directory (Planned Economy)
  * **Google Pagerank**: Based on Votes (People's Power)

# Collective Intelligence and Wisdom of Crowds
* The Internet is providing a platform at which diverse groups of people can pool knowledge, collaborate, debate interpretations and refine their understanding of the world, but such collective wisdom can only occur under certain conditions.
* **Connectivism**:
* **Double Bridge Experiment**:
* **Cognition**:
* **Cooperation**:
* **Coordination**:
* **Circular Mill**:
* **Tragedy of Commons**:

# Folksonomy
* Keyword: **Social**

* **Folksonomy**: Result of personal free tagging; done by users, not professionals
  * **Pros**: Simple, Low Cost, Open Ended, Relevance, Easy to Tag
  * **Cons**: No Structure, Errors, Limited Applicability, Scale, Quality
    * Polysemy: Same Tag, Different Meaning
    * Synonyms: Different Tag, Same Meaning
    * Plural vs Singular
    * Acronyms
* **Tag Cloud**: Visual Represtntations of the popularity of social tags
* **Emergent Behavior**: Self-Organization, Bottom-Up
  * Agents are dynamically interacting
  * System is adaptive and grows smarter over time
* **Applications:**
  * Pinterest
  * Flickr Tags: Over 90% of content, **Long Tail of Tag**
  * LibraryThing: Social Cataloging System for Books


# Crowdsourcing
* An application of collective intelligence
* **Open Innovation**
