# Network Effect and Long Tail
* Allow Web 2.0 services to scale (supply and demand side)
* **Network Effect**: Value of a product increases as the number of users grows (eg. Windows, Facebook, eBay, Bluray, 3pin Sockets)
  * **Sources**: P2P Communication (Telephone), Trading Volume (eBay), Nodes in a Network (Bittorrent), User-Generated Content (Wikipedia)
  * **Congestion**: More users = Less Valuable (Traffic, Internet Congestion)
* **Bandwagon Effect**: Probability of any individual adopting a serving increases with the proportion of who've already done so
* **Network Structure**
  * One Sided: Derive their value from a single class of users (eg. WeChat, Facebook)
  * Two Sided: Derive value from two categories of network participants (eg. eBay, Uber)

* **Long Tail**: Products with low demand = 80 (Tail), Best Sellers = 20 (Head)
  * Market Shares of the 80 rival or exceed the 20
  * Chris Anderson
* **Pareto's Principle**: 20% of anything produces 80% the effort
* **Effects of LT on Web 2.0**
  * **Democratize the tools of production**: More Material -> Longer Tail, eg. Garage Band, Wikipedia
