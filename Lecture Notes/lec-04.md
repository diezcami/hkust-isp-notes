# Collective Intelligence (CI) vs Wisdom of Crowds (WoC)

## Collective Intelligence: Definitions
* **Kasparov versus the World (1999)**: Individually, it's hard to play with with Kasparov. As a group, however, it's more possible.
* **Separate Definitions**:
  * **Intelligence**
    * Capability of a system to adapt its behavior to meet its goals in a range of environments
    * The ability to solve hard problems
  * **Collective**: Of, relating to, characteristic of, or made by a number of people acting as a group
* **Definitions**
  * **Distributed Intelligence**: Decentralized
  * **Coordinated**: Synchronized
  * **Human Community**:
    * Community of Practice: Professional Skills
    * More complex problem solving
  * **Web 2.0 Definitions**: Distributed, but connected
    * **Networked Culture**: Connected Culture
    * **Diverse Groups**: Not homogenous, people have different backgrounds
* **Characteristics**
  * Nobody knows everything, but everybody knows something
  * What a member knows is accessible to another member
  * Key: Share correct information, evaluate each other's contributions, reach consensus
* **Identifiers**:
  * Group of Actors (Ants)
  * Set of resources available to those actors (Food)
  * Set of actions the actors take (Leave Pheremone)
  * Collective result of those actions (Accumulations of the Pheremone)
  * A way of evaluating the result (Amount of Food/ Total distance taken)
* **Collective Behavior in Ant Colonies**
  * Leave pheremone (flag) behind to mark explored areas
  * Double Bridge Experiment

## Connectivism
  * Long ago, it was possible for a single person to surpass everyone in knowledge.
  * Now, knowledge is distributed/decentralized and interconnected
  * Harness latent microexpertise (eg. Yahoo Answers)
  * Designed Serendipity: Chance that one idea will stimulate another idea

## Wisdom of Crowds
* Author: James Surowiecki
* **Main Pont**: Collective outcome is better than individual results, and diversibility beats ability
* **Types of Problems**
  * Cognition (eg. Challenger Disaster)
  * Cooperation (eg. BitTorrent)
  * Coordination: Cooperation + Synchronization
*
