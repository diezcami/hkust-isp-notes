# Folksonomy and Social Media

## Pinterest

```
Similar to Delicious or StumbleUpon, Pinterest is a collaborative tagging system. Recent research has shown that these systems have powerful self-organizing behaviors. As the "wisdom of crowds" converges, it results in what is called a "folksonomy." Folksonomies dramatically lower the barriers to information sharing, as well as discovery. Pinterest "one-upped" the game on link-sharing by tacking on self-expression, a most vital social currency. It nailed information relevance and social behavior in a single package.

This is where Pinterest comes in, introducing a powerful concept, one of establishing relevance and connections through shared interests. With Pinterest, it’s the things we like that connect us. It's a natural propensity, one that mimics the way we behave with our connections in real life. Pinterest’s focus on the interest graph as opposed to the social graph—and its success with this strategy—has cast doubt on the long-standing belief that we want to discover content primarily though our social connections. 

Finally, while other social networks have largely focused on static sharing behaviors (think "liked," "stumbled," "digged," "read," "watched" and "checked in," all coming soon into a "timeline"), Pinterest is focused on fluidly bringing users together through visual discovery, while connecting them to the stories and authors behind "pins," whether they be trusted friends, interesting strangers, or brands thinking creatively.

## Library Thing
```
Tim Spalding, founder and president of LibraryThing, which is based in Portland, Me., says that while the site was founded in 2005, it is still in what he calls “perpetual beta,” as the software is steadily being improved. “We plan on staying in beta,” he said. “It’s a sign of constant innovation.” 

Based on data gathered at the site, Mr. Spalding has written programs that recommend books that members may want to read, or may want to skip, based on their own interests. For instance, he said, if you liked “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions” by Thomas S. Kuhn, the program suggests that you are not likely to enjoy “The Virgin’s Lover” by Philippa Gregory.

One way that Mr. Spalding generates site statistics is by analyzing the tags or key words that people use to help them categorize and remember their books. For example, people cataloguing a new detective novel by Donna Leon might add tags like “Guido Brunetti” (the sleuth) or “Venice” (the setting).

# Crowdsourcing
```
Thanks to Cho and tens of thousands of other volunteer respondents, Web users in one of the world's most-wired countries seldom "Google" anything - they "Naver" it.

Tapping a South Korean inclination to help one another on the Web has made Naver.com the undisputed leader of Internet search in the country. It handles more than 77 percent of all Web searches originating in South Korea, thanks largely to content generated, free of charge, by people like Park and Cho.

people do not just want information when they log on; they want a sense of community and the kind of human interaction provided by Naver's "Knowledge iN" real-time question-and-answer platform.

Naver has so far accumulated a user-generated database of 70 million entries. Typical queries include why North Korea is building a nuclear bomb, which digital music player is best, why people have hair whorls and what a high-school boy should do when he has a crush on a female teacher.

"I am no scholar, but I know how to get from place A to B in my town," said Cho, who so far has answered 2,520 Knowledge iN questions, mostly about traffic routes in Busan. "The best thing about Knowledge iN is that you can pick people's brains whenever you want."

Leveraging the so-called "collective intelligence" of Web users has become a way of life in South Korea, and has dramatically changed people's assumptions about what they can accomplish online.

To reward Cho's active supply of quality answers in the past two years, Naver recently named him an "honorary intellectual," a status coveted among Naver contributors.
