# Folksonomy and Social Media

## Pinterest

```
Similar to Delicious or StumbleUpon, Pinterest is a collaborative tagging system. Recent research has shown that these systems have powerful self-organizing behaviors. As the "wisdom of crowds" converges, it results in what is called a "folksonomy." Folksonomies dramatically lower the barriers to information sharing, as well as discovery. Pinterest "one-upped" the game on link-sharing by tacking on self-expression, a most vital social currency. It nailed information relevance and social behavior in a single package.

This is where Pinterest comes in, introducing a powerful concept, one of establishing relevance and connections through shared interests. With Pinterest, it’s the things we like that connect us. It's a natural propensity, one that mimics the way we behave with our connections in real life. Pinterest’s focus on the interest graph as opposed to the social graph—and its success with this strategy—has cast doubt on the long-standing belief that we want to discover content primarily though our social connections. 

Finally, while other social networks have largely focused on static sharing behaviors (think "liked," "stumbled," "digged," "read," "watched" and "checked in," all coming soon into a "timeline"), Pinterest is focused on fluidly bringing users together through visual discovery, while connecting them to the stories and authors behind "pins," whether they be trusted friends, interesting strangers, or brands thinking creatively.

## Library Thing
```
Tim Spalding, founder and president of LibraryThing, which is based in Portland, Me., says that while the site was founded in 2005, it is still in what he calls “perpetual beta,” as the software is steadily being improved. “We plan on staying in beta,” he said. “It’s a sign of constant innovation.” 

Based on data gathered at the site, Mr. Spalding has written programs that recommend books that members may want to read, or may want to skip, based on their own interests. For instance, he said, if you liked “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions” by Thomas S. Kuhn, the program suggests that you are not likely to enjoy “The Virgin’s Lover” by Philippa Gregory.

One way that Mr. Spalding generates site statistics is by analyzing the tags or key words that people use to help them categorize and remember their books. For example, people cataloguing a new detective novel by Donna Leon might add tags like “Guido Brunetti” (the sleuth) or “Venice” (the setting).
