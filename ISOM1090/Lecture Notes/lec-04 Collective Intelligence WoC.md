# Collective Intelligence (CI) vs Wisdom of Crowds (WoC)

## Collective Intelligence: Definitions
* **Kasparov versus the World (1999)**: Individually, it's hard to play with with Kasparov. As a group, however, it's more possible.
* **Separate Definitions**:
  * **Intelligence**
    * Capability of a system to adapt its behavior to meet its goals in a range of environments
    * The ability to solve hard problems
  * **Collective**: Of, relating to, characteristic of, or made by a number of people acting as a group
* **Definitions**
  * **Distributed Intelligence**: Decentralized
  * **Coordinated**: Synchronized
  * **Human Community**:
    * Community of Practice: Professional Skills
    * More complex problem solving
  * **Web 2.0 Definitions**: Distributed, but connected
    * **Networked Culture**: Connected Culture
    * **Diverse Groups**: Not homogenous, people have different backgrounds
* **Characteristics**
  * Nobody knows everything, but everybody knows something
  * What a member knows is accessible to another member
  * Key: Share correct information, evaluate each other's contributions, reach consensus
* **Identifiers**:
  * Group of Actors (Ants)
  * Set of resources available to those actors (Food)
  * Set of actions the actors take (Leave Pheremone)
  * Collective result of those actions (Accumulations of the Pheremone)
  * A way of evaluating the result (Amount of Food/ Total distance taken)
* **Collective Behavior in Ant Colonies**
  * Leave pheremone (flag) behind to mark explored areas
  * Double Bridge Experiment

## Connectivism
  * Long ago, it was possible for a single person to surpass everyone in knowledge.
  * Now, knowledge is distributed/decentralized and interconnected
  * Harness latent microexpertise (eg. Yahoo Answers)
  * Designed Serendipity: Chance that one idea will stimulate another idea

## Wisdom of Crowds
* Author: James Surowiecki
* **Main Pont**: Collective outcome is better than individual results, and diversibility beats ability
* **Types of Problems**
  * Cognition (eg. Who wants to be a Millionaire, Challenger Disaster, Newsfutures)
  * Cooperation (eg. BitTorrent)
  * Coordination: (Shall We Dance?, Meeting in Central) A person has to think not about what he believes is right but also take into account what others think
* **Four Conditions**
  * **Diversity**: 
    * Difference beats homogeneity, diversity yields superior outcomes.
    * Each member of the crowd needs latent microexpertise
  * **Independence**: Decisions should be free from the crowd mentality (eg. Circular Mill)
  * **Decentralization**: Decisions are made by individuals (eg. Open Source, Wikipedia)
  * **Aggregation**: Summarizing opinion into one collective verdict

## Factors Inhibiting Collective Intelligence
* **Groupthink and Informational Cascades**: 
  * Some people only conform instead of objectively contributing
  * *Remedy: Foster Diversity and Independence*
  * A severe case of mistaken consensus

In 1988, the surgeon general, C. Everett Koop, proclaimed ice cream to a be public-health menace right up there with cigarettes. Alluding to his office’s famous 1964 report on the perils of smoking, Dr. Koop announced that the American diet was a problem of “comparable” magnitude, chiefly because of the high-fat foods that were causing coronary heart disease and other deadly ailments.

The notion that fatty foods shorten your life began as a hypothesis based on dubious assumptions and data; when scientists tried to confirm it they failed repeatedly. The evidence against Häagen-Dazs was nothing like the evidence against Marlboros.

It may seem bizarre that a surgeon general could go so wrong. After all, wasn’t it his job to express the scientific consensus? But that was the problem. Dr. Koop was expressing the consensus. He, like the architects of the federal “food pyramid” telling Americans what to eat, went wrong by listening to everyone else. He was caught in what social scientists call a cascade.

We like to think that people improve their judgment by putting their minds together, and sometimes they do. The studio audience at “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” usually votes for the right answer. But suppose, instead of the audience members voting silently in unison, they voted out loud one after another. And suppose the first person gets it wrong.

Cascades are especially common in medicine as doctors take their cues from others, leading them to overdiagnose some faddish ailments (called bandwagon diseases) and overprescribe certain treatments (like the tonsillectomies once popular for children). Unable to keep up with the volume of research, doctors look for guidance from an expert — or at least someone who sounds confident.

Second, there wasn’t really a new epidemic of heart disease. Yes, more cases were being reported, but not because people were in worse health. It was mainly because they were living longer and were more likely to see a doctor who diagnosed the symptoms.

* **Social Dilemmas**:
  * Some people slack off and do not contribute
  * **Tragedy of Commons**: Sacrificing long term profit for short term gain
  * *Remedy: Reward Individual Participation*
* **Coordination Failures**:
  * Contributions cancel out with each other
  * *Remedy: Coordinate individual contribution*

## Dumbness of Crowd
* Consensus != Correctness

## Folksonomy
  * Taxonomy: The science of classifying things
