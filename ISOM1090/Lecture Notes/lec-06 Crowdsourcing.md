Even the near-miss losers in the Netflix million-dollar-prize competition seemed to have few regrets.

Netflix, the movie rental company, announced on Monday that a seven-man team was the winner of its closely watched three-year contest to improve its Web site’s movie recommendation system. That was expected, but the surprise was in the nail-biter finish.

The losing team, as it turned out, precisely matched the performance of the winner, but submitted its entry 20 minutes later, just before the final deadline expired.

Indeed, since it began in October 2006, the Netflix contest was significant less for the prize money than as a test case for new ideas about how to efficiently foster innovation in the Internet era — notably, offering prizes as an incentive and encouraging online collaboration to tap minds worldwide.

InnoCentive is a marketplace for business projects, where companies post challenges — often in areas like product development or applied science — and workers or teams compete for cash payments or prizes offered by the companies. 

Win or lose, researchers agreed that they entered the contest in good part to get access to the Netflix data.

there was a research community out there that worked on these kinds of models and was starving for data.
