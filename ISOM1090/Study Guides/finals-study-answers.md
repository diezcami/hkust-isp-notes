# Readings

## The Web is Dead, Long Live the Internet
* **Why does Chris Anderson proclaim the web is dead?**
  * The focus shifted from searching to getting.
  * We are abandoning the web for simpler and sleeker services in the form of apps. We use the Internet throughout the day to access services offered by apps without having to step. With this platform, it is easier for users to consume their data (the screen goes to us, we don't go to the screen) and for companies to make money.
  * Certain sites such as Facebook are so large that they are "not Websites at all". The web became less open in favor of the rising dominance of business platforms. 
  * Technologies such as API, apps and the smart phone allow for a more optimized experience on small mobile devices, as opposed to using general-purpose browsers. Fast beats Flexible.
* **What underlying assumptions was he making?**
  * The shift reflects the inevitable course of capitalism, due to how we shift from the open web to web platforms (larger than average web sites) and apps owned by companies.
  * Top 10 websites accounted for 75% of pageviews in 2010.

## Does the Internet make you smarter?
* **What are the author's arguments on why critics are wrong?**
  * Every increase in freedom to create/consume media alarms people accustomed to restrictions of the old system.
  * *Recent past was a glorious and irreplaceable "golden age" of intellectual attainment*
    * The past was not as rosy as they describe. The internet actually restores reading and writing as central activities in our culture.
  * *Present is characterized by sillty stuff and not noble experiments*
    * We should not be looking at the "clutter" of dumb stuff lying around, but for the good ideas that will survive into the future (eg. Open Source Software).
  * *Our generation of young people will fail to invent cultural norms for the Internet as the 17th century did for print culture*
    * It is our misfortune to live through the largest expansion in expressive capability in human history, because of the sheer abundance.
* **Why does he believe the Internet makes us smarter?**
  * Using the internet, we built new norms around newly abundant and contemporary culture, eg. Peer Review through Wikipedia, Open Source Software, Searches as giant distributed efforts.
  * Ushadidi, PatientsLikeMe

## Does the Internet make you dumber?
* **Underlying reasons used by the author**
  * We are turning into shallow and superficial thinkers due to the Internet's constant distractions and interruptions.
    * People comprehend and understand less of what they consume due to distractions.
  * **Division of Attention**: What digital natives are used to. Thinking is less rigorous and more automatic. This effect does not go away even after turning off our computers and cellphones.
  * **State of Perpetual Locomotion**: Compromising our capacity to engage in quieter, attentive modes of thought that underpin contemplation, reflection and introspection.
  * **Loss of Mental Discipline**

## Open Source Everywhere
* **Reasons for the rise of open source**
* **Story of Wikipedia**
* **Why people contribute to social media and open source**
* **Ideals of Open Source**

## In Digital Age, Advancing a Flexible Copyright System
* **Why do artists prefer a different approach to copyright?**
  * CC allows creators to copy, remix and sample content as long as the original creator is credited. This allows people to be more creative without being restricted by the law.
  * Moving away from a maximalist position where anyone can be creative without taking away rights.
  * CC is not perfect but it gives artists added control and reduces legal licensing costs.

## Stabilization won't save us
* **Pros and Cons of Centralization**
  * **Cons**
    * Deficit Prone - tend to be gamed by large corporations which increases their size to get bailed (moral hazard)
    * Large companies are too big to fail
* **Pros and Cons of Decentralization**
  * **Pros**: Premise - we cannot stop making mistakes, so make sure impact is limited and localized and useful in our long term prosperity and growth
    * Errors are smaller by nature - if one sector becomes bankrupt, the whole system would not be destabilized.
    * Problems can be solved early - since problems are smaller, stakeholders are more willing to pay and solve local challenges
    * People are taught to fail early and often, as they would not destabilize the economy as a whole


## How the tea party is rewriting the rule book of political organizing
* **Pros and Cons of Centralization**
  * Like a spider, a hierarchical system dies if you thump it on the head.

* **Pros and Cons of Decentralization**
  * **Pros**
    * Can direct resources and adapt faster than corporations can
    * Knowledge and power are distributed throughout the system - impervious to decapitation
