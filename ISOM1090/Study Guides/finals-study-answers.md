## Social Media
* **Define Egalitarian**: Equality in fundamental worth or social status
* **Differences between Social and Traditional Media**
  * Traditional Media: Passive audience, requires resources to broadcast, requires specialized skills and training, one to many

Connectedness refers to people being connected to other people and their content. Community refers to common interests and fostering the sharing of opinions to grow closer. Conversation refers to how social media is not a mere monologue. 
  * **Types of Intelligence from User Generated Content**
  * Implicit: Unstructured formats - blog posts, forum posts
  * Explicit: Structured formats - reviews, tags, votes
  * Derived: Intelligent Search, Aggregated Data

## Blog
* **Blogosphere**: Blogs considered collectively with their writers and readers as a distinct online network
* **Mainstream Media vs Blog**: As the Blogosphere grows, the line between MM and Blogs become less clear. Larger blogs take characteristics of mainstream sites, while mainstream sites also incorporate formats from the blog.
* **Permalink**: The actual link to a blog post
* **Twitter**: A platform for microblogging, providing real time information from real people. It provides a network of followers, a network of followers of followers etc in under 140 characters.
* **Is Blog Dead?**
  * Functions of blogs are now handled by blog-like disparate media forms (eg. Reddit, Tumblr, Instagram, Snapchat). People create personal content and share them on these platforms.
* **Subject Matter of the following blogs/magazines:**
  * Huffington Post: Regular news similar to what a newspaper would have. The headline resembles a newspaper, but the rest of the page contains featured blog posts mixed with news articles.
  * Boingboing: Common themes include technology, intellectual property, science fiction, futurism etc (geek stuff). It has content that can be seen in a newspaper's technology section
  * Gawker: Sensationalist posts and gossip more so than news
  * Gizmodo: Tech Industry and Technology in general

## Social Networking
* **Six Degrees of Separation**: Stanley Milgram - Theory that we are six or fewer nodes away from knowing people in a network
* **Online Social Network vs Offline Network**
  * Social Networks can have a huge potential if the people belong to it and their connections are visible (solved by social networking sites)
  * Offline Network: Farther connections are harder to establish, Clustered/ Groups
  * Online Network: Easier to look for people, Crude Representation of our offline network (Bucket of Friends), 
* **Dunbar's Number**: People can only hold about 150 meaningful relationships in their heads
* **Strength of Relationships**
  * Strong: Tend to be inside our own network, will remain regardless of the presence of social media
  * Weak: Made easier to connect with using Social Networks, Form Bridges to different networks, Take less time to build
  * Temporary: No recognized relationship with, just temporarily interact with 

## Wiki
* **What is Wiki?**: Style of website consisting of a simple syntax (Edit, Save, Link) to compose and edit pages
* **Benefits of Wiki**: Fast and easy to use, Transparent, Collaborative, Community
* **Comparison between Wiki and Blog**:
  * Blog: Write, Publish, Comment

* **Core Rules of Wikipedia**
  * Neutral Point of View
  * Verifiability
  * No Original Research
* **Winning Formula**
  * Philosophy of Equipotentiality: Belief that all participants can contribute something useful (Wisdom of Crowd)
  * Probabilistic, Parallelised: Mistakes have a higher change of being corrected than if reviewed by only one person
  * Granular: Smallest contributions count, which make the barrier of participation very low
  * Shared Ownership: Absence of editors means contributors feel immediately responsible for projects
* **Spectrum of Lightweight to Heavyweight Collaboration**
  * Lightweight (Cognition, Voting): Counting Votes (eg. Reddit, Estimating Amounts, PageRank or Hub/Authority Algorithms)
  * Middle (Folksonomy, Information): Systems used to organize information, Tagging (eg. Flickr, Diigo)
  * High-End (Wiki/Systems, Co-Creation): Utilize Systems and make sense of complex topics (eg. Wikipedia, Slashdot, eHow, Lostpedia, Harry Potter Wiki)

## Open Source
* **Comparison of software in terms of freedom to modify, etc**
* **LAMP**: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PhP/Python/Perl
* **The Cathedral and the Bazaar**
  * Cathedral: Hierarchical, Top Down, Formal, Closed (eg. Taxonomy, Britannica)
  * Bazaar: Decentralized, Bottom Up, Informal, Open (eg. Folksonomy, Wikipedia)
* **Copyleft and how it applied to software**
  * Form of licensing where an author surrenders some but not all rights under copyright law. Gist: Source Code/Modification Support must be available, Original author must be acknowledged.
* **Similarity between Wikipedia and Open Source**
  * **Emergent System Characteristics**: Each article is better than the contribution of each individual
  * Encourages Communal Involvement
  * Improved project maintanability (successors)
  * Gets incrementally better through voluntary contribution
  * Publish then filter
  * Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow
* **Open Courseware**: Is a collection of high quality learning materials (Planning Materials, Subject Materials, Learning Materials, Related Sources), has materials for Transformation (Rework, Remix, Redistribute, Reuse)
* **The motivation in sharing economy**: Reciprocity, Reputation, Sense of Efficacy, Need
* **What is Public Good?**
  * **Pure Indivisibility**: Consuming a product does not reduce amount available to others
  * Information or Digital Goods are uniquely suited to be exchanged in a sharing economy
  * Info on the internet is a Public Good

## Creative Commons

  * Web 2.0 focuses on shared open content and collaboration. CC ensures that people can use and share intelligence without the repurcussions of the law, and grants them the permission ahead to copy/distribute, perform, build upon and remix 
* **Difference between human and lawyer readable codes**
  * Human readable: Summary of the license and what you can/cannot do with it; user friendly interface to actual license

  * A web application that uses content from more than one source to create a single new service displayed in a single graphical interface. A picture is worth a thousand words, the main characteristics of a mashup are combination, visualization, and aggregation.
  * Their purpose lies in using information and delivering content better for users
  * Eg. Coverpop, Books-Like-This, Mapwow, Mapdango, Twittervision, Pubwalk

# Readings

## The Web is Dead, Long Live the Internet
* **Why does Chris Anderson proclaim the web is dead?**
  * The focus shifted from searching to getting.
  * We are abandoning the web for simpler and sleeker services in the form of apps. We use the Internet throughout the day to access services offered by apps without having to step. With this platform, it is easier for users to consume their data (the screen goes to us, we don't go to the screen) and for companies to make money.
  * Certain sites such as Facebook are so large that they are "not Websites at all". The web became less open in favor of the rising dominance of business platforms. 
  * Technologies such as API, apps and the smart phone allow for a more optimized experience on small mobile devices, as opposed to using general-purpose browsers. Fast beats Flexible.
* **What underlying assumptions was he making?**
  * The shift reflects the inevitable course of capitalism, due to how we shift from the open web to web platforms (larger than average web sites) and apps owned by companies.
  * Top 10 websites accounted for 75% of pageviews in 2010.

## Does the Internet make you smarter?
* **What are the author's arguments on why critics are wrong?**
  * Every increase in freedom to create/consume media alarms people accustomed to restrictions of the old system.
  * *Recent past was a glorious and irreplaceable "golden age" of intellectual attainment*
    * The past was not as rosy as they describe. The internet actually restores reading and writing as central activities in our culture.
  * *Present is characterized by sillty stuff and not noble experiments*
    * We should not be looking at the "clutter" of dumb stuff lying around, but for the good ideas that will survive into the future (eg. Open Source Software).
  * *Our generation of young people will fail to invent cultural norms for the Internet as the 17th century did for print culture*
    * It is our misfortune to live through the largest expansion in expressive capability in human history, because of the sheer abundance.
* **Why does he believe the Internet makes us smarter?**
  * Using the internet, we built new norms around newly abundant and contemporary culture, eg. Peer Review through Wikipedia, Open Source Software, Searches as giant distributed efforts.
  * Ushadidi, PatientsLikeMe

## Does the Internet make you dumber?
* **Underlying reasons used by the author**
  * We are turning into shallow and superficial thinkers due to the Internet's constant distractions and interruptions.
    * People comprehend and understand less of what they consume due to distractions.
  * **Division of Attention**: What digital natives are used to. Thinking is less rigorous and more automatic. This effect does not go away even after turning off our computers and cellphones.
  * **State of Perpetual Locomotion**: Compromising our capacity to engage in quieter, attentive modes of thought that underpin contemplation, reflection and introspection.
  * **Loss of Mental Discipline**

## Open Source Everywhere
* **Reasons for the rise of open source**
  * The rise of the internet - open source's great enabler and efficient communication tool that makes massively decentralized projects possible
  * The excesses of intellectual property (copyright) - open source's greatest nemesis: a legal regime that was so restrictive that thousands of professionals were desperate to find new ways to create (alternative to the status quo, since current methods are not fast/ambitious/creative enough)
* **Story of Wikipedia**
  * Nupedia's closed source approach failed miserably => Wikipedia's open source approach won
* **Why people contribute to social media and open source**
  * The participation in making the world what we want and what we think it should be (Greater Good, Altruism)
  * Compulsiveness
  * Applying professional knowledge to a broad audience (Egotism)
* **Ideals of Open Source**
  * **Share the Goal**: Recognize the same need and agree on how to meet it
  * **Share the Work**: Break projects down into smaller tasks and distribute to volunteers
  * **Share the Result**: Let code be available for anyone to tweak and improve

## In Digital Age, Advancing a Flexible Copyright System
* **Why do artists prefer a different approach to copyright?**
  * CC allows creators to copy, remix and sample content as long as the original creator is credited. This allows people to be more creative without being restricted by the law.
  * Moving away from a maximalist position where anyone can be creative without taking away rights.
  * CC is not perfect but it gives artists added control and reduces legal licensing costs.

## Stabilization won't save us
* **Pros and Cons of Centralization**
  * **Cons**
    * Deficit Prone - tend to be gamed by large corporations which increases their size to get bailed (moral hazard)
    * Large companies are too big to fail
* **Pros and Cons of Decentralization**
  * **Pros**: Premise - we cannot stop making mistakes, so make sure impact is limited and localized and useful in our long term prosperity and growth
    * Errors are smaller by nature - if one sector becomes bankrupt, the whole system would not be destabilized.
    * Problems can be solved early - since problems are smaller, stakeholders are more willing to pay and solve local challenges
    * People are taught to fail early and often, as they would not destabilize the economy as a whole

## How the tea party is rewriting the rule book of political organizing
* **Pros and Cons of Centralization**
  * **Cons**
    * Like a spider, a hierarchical system dies if you thump it on the head.
* **Pros and Cons of Decentralization**
  * **Pros**
    * Can direct resources and adapt faster than corporations can
    * Knowledge and power are distributed throughout the system - impervious to decapitation
