# Readings

## The Web is Dead, Long Live the Internet
* **Why does Chris Anderson proclaim the web is dead?**
  * The focus shifted from searching to getting.
  * We are abandoning the web for simpler and sleeker services in the form of apps. We use the Internet throughout the day to access services offered by apps without having to step. With this platform, it is easier for users to consume their data (the screen goes to us, we don't go to the screen) and for companies to make money.
  * Certain sites such as Facebook are so large that they are "not Websites at all". The web became less open in favor of the rising dominance of business platforms. 
  * Technologies such as API, apps and the smart phone allow for a more optimized experience on small mobile devices, as opposed to using general-purpose browsers. Fast beats Flexible.
* **What underlying assumptions was he making?**
  * The shift reflects the inevitable course of capitalism, due to how we shift from the open web to web platforms (larger than average web sites) and apps owned by companies.
  * Top 10 websites accounted for 75% of pageviews in 2010.
