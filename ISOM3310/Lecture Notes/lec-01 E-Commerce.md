# E-Commerce

## E-Commerce Takes Off

online consumers are rapidly becoming just like offline consumers. So it should come as no surprise that, just as it was on the high street, clothing was the biggest category of goods sold online in America last Christmas. Similar trends are already evident in Europe and will no doubt spread to Asia.

But e-commerce involves a lot more than retail sales and services such as travel, in which more than half of all bookings are expected to move online within a few years. 

business-to-business (B2B) services, already worth more than $1 trillion a year according to some estimates. Wal-Mart, for one, now conducts all its business with suppliers over a proprietary B2B network.

So they should: leading websites, after early teething problems, now provide a superb service.

websites have had little choice but to raise service levels, often far above those of offline retailers. Competition on the web is fierce. Price transparency is the rule. With shopping-comparison services, it is possible to check the price offered by hundreds of merchants with a couple of mouse clicks. Consumers also have access to an unprecedented amount of product information, not just from manufacturers' websites but also from online reviews written by previous customers.

three out of four customers walking into a car showroom have already researched their choice online, down to what colour and accessories they want. And most will know exactly what they need to pay. Some will even have armed themselves with competing quotes from different dealers, often by using specialist websites. Much the same thing is happening with other goods and services, from domestic appliances to holidays.

 The internet has shrunk the cost of going into business. For the price of a personal computer, a fast connection and a good website, anyone with an entrepreneurial flair now has the potential to reach customers worldwide.

## A Perfect Market

WHEN the technology bubble burst in 2000, the crazy valuations for online companies vanished with it, and many businesses folded.

The funny thing is that the wild predictions made at the height of the boom—namely, that vast chunks of the world economy would move into cyberspace—are, in one way or another, coming true.

travel services, one of the most successful and fastest-growing sectors of e-commerce.

the fees earned by internet auction sites, but not the value of goods that are sold: an astonishing $24 billion-worth of trade was done last year on eBay

billions of dollars-worth of goods bought and sold by businesses connecting to each other over the internet. 

But the actual value of transactions currently concluded online is dwarfed by the extraordinary influence the internet is exerting over purchases carried out in the offline world.

To start with, the internet is profoundly changing consumer behaviour. One in five customers walking into a Sears department store in America to buy an electrical appliance will have researched their purchase online—and most will know down to a dime what they intend to pay. More surprisingly, three out of four Americans start shopping for new cars online, even though most end up buying them from traditional dealers. The difference is that these customers come to the showroom armed with information about the car and the best available deals. Sometimes they even have computer print-outs identifying the particular vehicle from the dealer's stock that they want to buy.

A company that neglects its website may be committing commercial suicide. A website is increasingly becoming the gateway to a company's brand, products and services—even if the firm does not sell online. A useless website suggests a useless company, and a rival is only a mouse-click away. But even the coolest website will be lost in cyberspace if people cannot find it, so companies have to ensure that they appear high up in internet search results.

For many users, a search site is now their point of entry to the internet.

But to take part, a company's products have to stand up to intense price competition. People check online prices, compare them with those in their local high street and may well take a peek at what customers in other countries are paying.

someone might use the internet to research digital cameras, but visit a photographic shop for a hands-on demonstration.

One of the biggest commercial advantages of the internet is a lowering of transaction costs, which usually translates directly into lower prices for the consumer. So, if the lowest prices can be found on the internet and people like the service they get, why would they buy anywhere else?

One reason may be convenience; another, concern about fraud, which poses the biggest threat to online trade. But as long as the internet continues to deliver price and product information quickly, cheaply and securely, e-commerce will continue to grow.

## E-Commerce Companies Bypass the Middlemen

When the founders of a start-up that sells eyeglasses online, Warby Parker, began investigating why designer glasses cost several hundred dollars, they discovered that everyone in the process was taking a cut: designers, manufacturers, brands, wholesalers and retailers.

the founders sketched a few frames, hired the same Chinese factories that make designer glasses and started selling directly to consumers online. 

Warby Parker is part of a wave of e-commerce companies that are trying to build premium brands at discount prices by cutting out middlemen and going straight to manufacturers.

They do not have as much brand recognition as big retailers, and persuading consumers to take a chance on, say, Warby Parker eyeglasses instead of Prada’s can be difficult.

What is empowering the upstarts now is the Web’s ability to reach lots of consumers without the costs of operating physical stores as well as a change in manufacturers’ willingness to work with small brands.

Where the factories had previously been unwilling to take small production orders, they were now eager for business — but they were concerned about getting paid, as they were already chasing down payments from errant retailers.

So Deal Décor approached manufacturers with an appealing proposal: it would pay them as the products were shipped, rather than a month or more later.
Deal Décor’s model was to sell couches or bookshelves on its Web site before they were in production. It timed the deals for when a factory was producing similar items for other clients and could easily add Deal Décor’s order. Deal Décor ordered the exact quantity it had sold and had the items shipped straight from the factory to customers eight to 16 weeks later.

“Going to factories in China is the easiest part of the process,” Mr. Blumenthal of Warby Parker said. “The hardest part is building a brand that stands for something and will resonate with customers.”

Even though selling online, and avoiding the costs of bricks-and-mortar stores, is one of the central tenets of e-commerce strategy, Warby Parker has found that many potential customers want to touch and hold its products. The company, based in New York, has contracted with boutiques in several major cities to display sample glasses, and it is also opening a stand-alone showroom.

## Copycat Business Model Generates Genuine Global Success for Start-Up Incubator

For Linio, think Amazon for Mexicans. For Zalora, think Zappos for Malaysians. For Easy Taxi, think Uber for Nigerians.

From its low-key offices near the center of the city, Rocket Internet has turned the usual business model for technology companies on its head, compiling a team of high-flying finance and management specialists and arming them with the money they need to mimic already successful Internet companies — applying these proven ideas in other countries, often in emerging markets.

The business model stands in sharp contrast with the ethos that dominates Silicon Valley, where originality is perceived as the main currency for successful start-ups. It also has raised questions over whether Europe’s tech sector, where Rocket is a major player, can ever foster the same level of innovation that has led to a conveyor belt of successful American tech giants like Oracle, Google and Facebook.
